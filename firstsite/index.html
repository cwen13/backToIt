	I am getting back to working on code and his is a starting point. I stepped away after my camp a bit to search for an engineering job. I was unable to find a software one and thought to fall back onto my schooling and see what happened. It has been 2 months and that too has not come through for me. So I now and looking for a software one again. I didn't mention but I was pricing myself out of the market previously thunking i could get eaht  Iwas getting in a different job. I have broken down the falacy and finding any work that with code camp will get me through.
      </p>
      <p>
	The next thing is now to see what I want to develope.
